## Description

This repo contains the boilerplate code for the eco.mio hiring challenge. What you are looking at is a stub version of a browser extension. Learn about how to get started below. But first, here is the task:

### Main task

Build a browser extension that augments the user experience for a travellers performing an air or rail search on <https://skyscanner.com> and <https://kayak.com>. This extension should do the following:

- Read out the user's destination from the site
- Provide the user in an intuitive way with dummy sustainability information of their trip
  - The data can be anything, e.g. a sustainability score of the destination
  - The data must be fetched from an SQL DB through a backend app (ideally written in Django, but you may choose also another stack)
- Save each search to the database (origin, time of search, data displayed to the user)

Bonus points will be awarded for:

- Tooltip on the element with some more (dummy) information
- Add any feature you think could benefit the app

Solve the task as if you were working on it in a professional, startup-like environment.\
Don't focus on perfect styling/UI.

### Questions and Submission

If you have any questions, do not hesitate to contact me (Mario) at <m@ecomio.com>. Once you are done with the task notify me via email (<m@ecomio.com>) and include the link to your repository.

## Prerequisites

1. Installed Chrome or Edge Browser
2. NodeJS from <https://nodejs.org/en/download/> (for npm)

## Installation

1. Create your own repository from the template and clone into it

2. Install the node modules: `npm install`

3. Build the extension in hot-reloading mode with `npm run watch`

4. Install the Quick Extension Reload Extension for easy reloading in development: <https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/quick-extension-reload/goeiakeofnlpkioeadcbocfifmgkidpb>.

5. Enable extension in the browser:
   1. Type chrome://extensions into the search bar on Chrome (edge://extensions for Edge).
   2. Enable "Developer mode" with top right switch (bottom left on Edge).
   3. Click "Load unpacked" and select the `extension-challenge/dist/` folder.

## Usage

1. To continuosly rebuild after code and file changes were saved we execute the following npm script: `npm run watch`

2. Before testing/debugging in the browser we need to refresh the extension in our browser: Press **"Alt" + "R"** when in the browser. (Requires the Quick Extension Reload Extension, see "Installation".)

Note: To apply changes in the code to the extension one could also manually do so by hitting the refresh arrow of the extension at `chrome://extensions/`.

## Project Structure

The overall project is structured as follows:

      extension-challenge
      ├── dist*
      ├── public
      ├── src
      └── webpack

_\*not checked in_

- **dist:**
  - the build files (once created)
- **public:**
  - all static files for the extension in general, like css and images
- **src:**
  - contains all the source code
- **webpack:**
  - webpack configuration files for development

\
The src folder of the project is structured as follows:

    src
    ├── assets
    ├── tests
    ├── types
    |
    └── main.ts

The subfolders serve the following purpose:

- **assets:**
  - folder containing the project's assets, currently just the extension logos
- **tests:**
  - tests (including end-to-end tests) for the project. Initially empty
- **types:**
  - custom types and interfaces.

And the file:

- **main.ts:**
  - where the magic happens. Main script that runs each time an allowed page is (re)loaded. Technically speaking a contentscript.

- `npm install` installs the necessary dependencies
- `npm run install:clean` deletes and reinstalls all dependencies
- `npm run watch` continuosly rebuild after code changes
- `npm run test` runs all tests of the project
